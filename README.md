# Itemmod Preset Binder (BakkesMod plugin)
Bind BakkesMod item mod codes to garage presets in Rocket League

[See it on the BakkesPlugins website](https://bakkesplugins.com/plugins/view/557)

## 🚀 Description
Create bindings to automatically apply an item mod code when equipping a garage preset. Ideal for players who frequently switch presets but want to avoid opening BakkesMod every time just to change items.
